pyoof is a Python package that contains all needed tools to perform out-of-focus (OOF) holography on astronomical beam maps for single dish radio telescopes. It is based on the original OOF holography papers,

* [Out-of-focus holography at the Green Bank Telescope](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/ps/2007/14/aa5765-06.ps.gz)
* [Measurement of antenna surfaces from in- and out-of-focus beam maps using astronomical sources](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/ps/2007/14/aa5603-06.ps.gz)

and [software](https://github.com/bnikolic/oof) developed by [Bojan Nikolic](http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~bn204/oof/).

For now the installation is only available from the source, clone the repository and then execute
